18178,ArunBasilLal,@MartinodF Well  Developer in the sense  I know its broader than a designer  but not sure of what it is  @sid88 hey bro  You missed this one  rgiht   me too  The updates are really slow  Looks like the guys are really involved there #bck5 @ManiKarthik I guess the sessions are too involving  Updates are poor and are mostly news and quotes  no tips are flowing out     #bck5 @DianaKhalil I am not into photography myself  and what I love is the urban and nature photos  So I am no one to comment on  Having had a First Hand experience being an outsider makes me eligible to rate the Updates  Its hard for an outsider to catch up  #bck5 @vishnupsp yea man  Missing #bck5 really hard   I am at Ma College of Engg  Kothamangalam  what do you do    @binnyva The lunch is done there    I didnt have mine yet  #bck5 @kazwccsocialnet if thats the case  It will take till today evening to get online     @tsuvik Hey  I would love to watch that too  Sadly no live links are available I guess  #bck5 Where did you guys learn to tweet    No offenss  but the updates are taking us nowhere  #bck5 @sebinaj Sad  we missed #bck5  @sebinaj  @remzology I noticed that too  Maybe the sessions are too engaging that they are not getting time to tweet    #bck5 @sebinaj  @remzology I was not getting anything productive out of the tweets  so I dropped finally   Now I kw hw wonderful #wci was  #bck5 @vishnupsp Studies started    I am yet to start  do uou have a psp at home    @bwsteam Hey  I didnt get the attachment this time too    @rmilana The idea of a call  seems exciting  but not untill November      #coffeeclub @rmilana Hey  I am on a limited Bandwidth connection till Novm  thats why    The others gave the time     #coffeeclub @hisaming The  #Coktup started in the wrong time  End of sem and exam time  I got exams on 25th  And Dad wouldnt let me get out    @rmilana Hey  Wahts happening in #coffeclub    I didnt have coffee for two days now  @dharshana @aravindkumar Whats up today    missed the #coffeeclub that day  Made a Time Table for Blogging for the first time  Hope it works well for me  @dharshana I went to bed actually  thinking #bck5 I couldnt sleep  so I came here to catch some friends  @SultanArun I am here bro  watching updates via Twitter Search #bck5 I am kinda in the party  @nijumohan Did you get your source registered    I tried making one  Use source as millionclues and see what happens  #kukku @kazwccsocialnet I guess lunch time is over there  i e  I cant leave now  Anyway  thanks  Lots of new followers  Pardon me  I am trying to catch up on a Local BarCamp  so my updates are really weird  I know  #bck5 @remzology True  BarCamps means freedom  #BCK5 @tsuvik me too  People take Facebook profile updates more seriously i guess  Just 3 or 4 updates a day  and they are happy  @tsuvik I guess we were looking for the theme   shh    Thanks for the link  Guys  please do upload the pics and presentations once #bck5 is done  please do share the links via the group  Keep rocking  @JuwalBose oops  eldhose bhai uploaded the same too  Did you read the hindu s article on BarCamp  Binny rocks man  @hiteshmehta Good here too  but not awesome  feeling hungry  @bwsteam btw  the author of that video gets indexed in less than 10 mins    @crazytwism Hmm  maybe I will  but I am not losing any moments at college anyway  I guess I know how to enjoy on the GO  @nikpages MACE  kothamangalam   which trade and sem    nice to meet you    @biliph oh I see  a girl said I was her bff  LOL  I got the wrong impression    @nikpages Thanks bro  Exam

that one    It rocks  glad that #coffeeclub has a blog now  In september maybe we can move to our own domain  @venkateshkumar Missing fun    When its not coming to me  I would make it  I know the recipe I believe   @createtomorrow Yes  but usually  people are too buzy to subscirbe to newsletters to get the pdf  I thought the links would help     @far1983 Lol  i usually take Late breakfasts
